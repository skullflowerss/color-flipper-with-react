# Random Color with RGB to HEX translator V1

Hardcoded in the best way

A simple random color maker with a translator.

I was having a hard time with the hex translator because breaks the site if you click again the "Hex" button. 

I just made sure that if the "hex option" was running dont translate and viceversa, the color string doesnt have the same properties or characteristics to make the conversion. I have to find a more effective/simple way to do this.
